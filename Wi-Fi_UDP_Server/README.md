# UDP server

This code example demonstrates the implementation of a UDP server with PSoC&trade; 6 MCU and AIROC™ CYW43xxx Wi-Fi & Bluetooth® combo chips.

In this example, the UDP server waits for the UDP client to establish the connection. Once the connection is established, the server allows the user to send the LED ON/OFF command to the UDP client through a button press; the client responds by sending an acknowledgement message to the server.

This example uses the Wi-Fi Core FreeRTOS lwIP mbedtls library of the SDK. This library enables application development based on Wi-Fi, by pulling wifi-connection-manager, FreeRTOS, lwIP, mbed TLS, secure sockets and other dependent modules. The secure sockets library provides an easy-to-use API by abstracting the network stack (lwIP) and the security stack (mbed TLS).

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

- Install a Python interpreter if you don't have one. This code example is tested with [Python 3.7.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/).


## Using the code example

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-wifi-udp-server](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-wifi-udp-server)" application with the desired name "UdpServer" configured for the *CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439 --app-id mtb-example-wifi-udp-client --user-app-name UdpServer --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

</details>



## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/psoc-64-secure-mcu-secure-boot-sdk-user-guide) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Modify the `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, and `WIFI_SECURITY_TYPE` macros to match the credentials of the Wi-Fi network that you want to connect. These macros are defined in the *udp_server.h* file. Ensure that the Wi-Fi network that you are connecting to is configured as a private network for the proper functioning of this example.

   **Note:** CYSBSYSKIT-01 reserves UDP and TCP port numbers from `49152` to `57343`.

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:

      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

5. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the following text as shown in **Figure 1** is displayed on the UART terminal. Note that Wi-Fi SSID and the IP address assigned will be different based on the network that you have connected to.

     **Figure 1. UART terminal showing the Wi-Fi connectivity status**

     ![](images/uart-terminal-output.png)


6. Ensure that your computer is connected to the same Wi-Fi access point that you have configured in **Step 2**. Make a note of the IP address assigned to the kit as shown in **Figure 1**.

7. Open a command shell from the project directory and run the Python UDP client (*udp_client.py*) with the IP address from **Figure 1** as an argument through the option `--hostname`.

   For example, if the IP address assigned to your kit is `192.168.43.231`, enter the command as follows:

   ```
   python udp_client.py --hostname 192.168.43.231
   ```

   **Note:** Ensure that the firewall settings of your computer allow access to the Python software so that it can communicate with the UDP server. For more details on enabling Python access, see this [community thread](https://community.infineon.com/t5/ModusToolbox-General/CE229112-Enable-Python-access-to-your-WiFi/td-p/214654).

8. Press the user button (**CYBSP_USER_BTN**) to send the LED ON/OFF command to the Python UDP client. Each user button press will issue the LED ON or LED OFF commands alternately. The client in turn sends an acknowledgement message back to the server. **Figure 2** and **Figure 3** show the UDP server and UDP client outputs respectively.

   **Figure 2. UDP server output**

   ![](images/udp-server-output.png)

   <br />

   **Figure 3. UDP client output**

   ![](images/udp-client-output.png)

   **Note:** Instead of using the Python UDP client (*udp_client.py*), you can use the [mtb-example-wifi-udp-server](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-wifi-udp-server) example to run as UDP server on the second kit. See the code example documentation to learn how to use the example.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-Eclipse_IDE_for_ModusToolbox_User_Guide_1-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99bcb86331e8).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/PSoC-6-MCU-Code-in-main-executes-before-the-debugger-halts-at-the-first-line-of/ta-p/253856) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

### Resources and settings

**Table 1. Application resources**

 Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose
 :-------- | :-------------    | :------------
 SDIO (HAL)| sdio_obj | SDIO interface for Wi-Fi connectivity
 UART (HAL) |cy_retarget_io_uart_obj| UART HAL object used by retarget-io for debug UART port 
 BUTTON (BSP) | CYBSP_USER_BTN | User button used to send LED ON/OFF commands to UDP server

<br>

This example uses the Arm® Cortex®-M4 (CM4) CPU of PSoC&trade; 6 MCU to execute an RTOS task: UDP Server task. At device reset, the default Cortex&reg;-M0+ (CM0+) application enables the CM4 CPU and configures the CM0+ CPU to go to sleep.

In this example, the UDP server waits for the UDP client to establish the connection. Once the connection completes, the server allows you to send the LED ON/OFF command to the UDP client; the client responds by sending an acknowledgement message to the server.

**Note:** The CY8CPROTO-062-4343W board shares the same GPIO for the user button (CYBSP_USER_BTN) and the AIROC™ CYW4343W Wi-Fi Bluetooth® combo chip host wakeup pin. Because this example uses the GPIO for interfacing with the user button, the SDIO interrupt to wake up the host is disabled by setting `CY_WIFI_HOST_WAKE_SW_FORCE` to '0' in the Makefile through the `DEFINES` variable.
